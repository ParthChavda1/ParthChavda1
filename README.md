# About Me

👋 Hi! I'm Parth - a systems engineer who loves building things from scratch.

## What I'm Working On
- 🌐 Network protocol simulator (TCP/IP stack implementation)
- 🔧 Compiler for custom 8-bit architecture
- 🔒 Security monitoring and auditing tools
- 🖥️ Linux system utilities and automation

## My Technical Journey
I started with networking (Cisco, VLANs, routing protocols) and fell in love 
with understanding how protocols work at the packet level. This led me to 
build my own network simulator to see TCP/IP in action.

Then I got curious about compilers and built one from scratch in C - from 
lexer to assembly generation. There's something magical about turning high-level 
code into machine instructions.

Now I'm exploring security engineering, building tools to monitor file integrity 
and audit privilege escalation vectors on Linux systems.

## Tech Stack
**Languages:** C/C++, Python, Assembly, Bash  
**Networking:** TCP/IP, OSPF, VLANs, Wireshark, Cisco Packet Tracer  
**Systems:** Linux (Debian/Ubuntu), Windows, compiler design  
**Tools:** Git, PyQt5, GCC, GDB  

## Achievements
